This small project was made with an udemy course to allow me to learn the fundamental notions of unity and c# scripts.
It is a simple Labyrinth, the user has to find a key and the exit door in a limited time.
You can import the unitypackage on the unityHub platform  to see more details of the project and the code.
Warning, some of textures and sprites were import from the unity store.
